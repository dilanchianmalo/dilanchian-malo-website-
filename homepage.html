  <h1 class="main-title">Dilanchian-Malo Adventures</h1>

  <p> Throughout the course of our relationship, we have explored hundreds of
  restaurants, seen hundreds of movies and driven hundreds and hundred of miles!
  <br>

<br> It was about time we put to use my love of words and photos with Alec's
love of coding and technology. This whole idea started when I taught myself to
code and make a website for our three year anniversary. From there it's bloomed
into our own, <em>personal</em> diary- a place to document our experiences and
love. <br>

<br> June 19th, 2013- Forever
