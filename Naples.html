<p> It’s safe to say this weekend was one that will <em>forever</em> be remembered.<br>

<br>As we were driving to Naples, we were both eager and impatient to arrive. The car ride was filled with laughter, dancing, and loud singing on my part. Using Alec’s hand as my microphone, I was belting out the words to my favorite oldies. Once we pulled into the driveway of the hotel, we were both happy to see it was exactly what we expected. The grand entrance assured us that we’d be having a phenomenal time during our weekend getaway. Once we finished struggling to self-park in the garage, we made our way to the lobby. The grandness of the lobby really cannot be captured through photos or videos. After checking in, we walked hand in hand to our secluded bungalow. We both have a taste for all things luxurious and Alec truly outdid himself with his hotel choice. The room was bigger than all the studio apartments I’ve lived in during college. We set our stuff down, changed into bathing suits, and set out to explore the rest of the resort. We smiled, talked and joked around as we went to the ballrooms, and the 18th floor in the building. I pulled him along and decided it would be a great idea to test out the water slide. To our surprise it was already closed but that did not stop us from taking a dip in the main pool. We then gathered our belongings, and made our way to the beach. We walked for .2 seconds and then were picked up by a kind man on a golf cart. When we arrived at the beach, we finally made one of my wishes come true- we watched as the sun begin to set over the water. We got in the water (by we I really just mean Alec since I cautiously dipped my toes in). It was warm and completely perfect. We then decided to head back to the adult swimming pool and lounge until the sun lost it’s strength completely. By the time we made it back to the room, it was time for a shower. The hunger quickly set in and we unabashedly spent too much money on room service food. Given it was already such a great day, we both figured it was okay to splurge. Shortly after our mac and cheese, chicken tenders, fries, and cookies, we said goodnight to the first day of our weekend getaway. <br>

<br>Day two started bright and early thanks to Alec’s relentless attempts to wake me with gentle kisses all over my face. We put on our bathing suits, threw on some coverups, and went out to breakfast. We decided to try EJs Bayfront Cafe thanks to the great reviews it had online. We weren’t let down by the delicious, home cooked feel of the food we ate. After stuffing ourselves with delicious goodness, we headed back to the resort. The entire morning and afternoon consisted of laying out, lounging in the pool, laying out, lounging in the pool. The complete and utter relaxation we both felt was something we had both been missing and longing for. After about three and a half hours of sun and refreshing water, we realized a child had a slight…. incident in the pool. We took that as our sign to go in search of lunch. Instead of looking up somewhere to go, we just set out to drive. Alec being the incredibly thoughtful man that the is decided the best place for us was The Bowl- a delicious acai bowl place! We each ordered our own and indulged in the tasty goodness of fruit, nuts, and nut butters. Once we were almost done we decided to head out to the gas station and buy lottery tickets. It’s a pretty casual event but it makes the cut for being mentioned because Alec proved to me once again just how incredible his heart is. After paying, we went back to the car and he did some quick calculations. The man who rang us up only charged him half of what he should have. Unlike most people I know, Alec went back inside and paid the man what he should have been charged. That man is absolutely incredible. Once back at the hotel, we showered and took a much needed nap in our king sized heaven. Once we woke up, we cleaned ourselves up a bit and headed to Victoria and Austin’s engagement party. We had a great time meeting their family and friends! At the end of the night, we bought a pizza, brought it back to our hotel and devoured it with our friends. Once again, the day was almost too good to be true. Once it was time to sleep, there was nothing but joy, love, and gratitude in both of our hearts. <br>

<br> The third morning was bittersweet. We woke up just in time to check out but were so reluctant to accept it was the end that we decided to extend our checkout time. We lounged, talked, and bonded even more than we already had (if that’s even possible!) Once it was time to go (again), we rinsed off and headed out. We enjoyed Einstein’s and a short car ride out of Naples. After this weekend it’s easy to say that we had some much needed time to further recharge, continue falling in love, and make memories. So here’s to our extraordinary time together in Naples, may we <em>always</em> find joy in each other.
